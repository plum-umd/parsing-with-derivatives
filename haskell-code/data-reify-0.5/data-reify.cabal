Name:               data-reify
Version:            0.5
Synopsis:           Reify a recursive data structure into an explicit graph.
Description:	    'data-reify' provided the ability to turn recursive structures into explicit graphs. 
		    Many (implicitly or explicitly) recursive data structure can be given this ability, via
		    a type class instance. This gives an alternative to using 'Ref' for observable sharing.
		    .
		    Observable sharing in general is unsafe, so we use the IO monad to bound this effect,
		    but can be used safely even with 'unsafePerformIO' if some simple conditions are met.
		    Typically this package will be used to tie the knot with DSL's that depend of
		    observable sharing, like Lava.
 		    .
		    Providing an instance for 'MuRef' is the mechanism for allowing a structure to be 
		    reified into a graph, and several examples of this are provided.
		    .
		    History: 
		    Version 0.1 used unsafe pointer compares.
		    Version 0.2 of 'data-reify' used 'StableName's, and was much faster.
		    Version 0.3 provided two versions of 'MuRef', the mono-typed version,
		    for trees of a single type,
		    and the dynamic-typed version, for trees of different types.
		    Version 0.4 used 'Int' as a synonym for 'Unique' rather than 'Data.Unique'
		    for node ids, by popular demand.
		    Version 0.5 merged the mono-typed and dynamic version again, by using 
		    'DynStableName', an unphantomized version of StableName.
