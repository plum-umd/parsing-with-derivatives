Updates and zippers by David Darais.

changes from older version:

derp-core:
  * changed token to token-p (to emphasize the fact that it takes a predicate)
    * token is now defined in terms of token-p
    * derp-test was written to use token as taking a literal and not a predicate
  * nth derivative is defined as a helper
derp-optimize:
  * renamed ∅? and ε? to essentially-∅? and essentially-ε? to avoid confusion and conflict
  * added missing δ case to essentially-ε
  * fixed incorrect bottom element for essentially-ε
  * added nullable? analysis (needed for missing δ case of essentially-∅)
  * fixed incorrect case for ε in essentially-∅
  * added missing δ case to essentially-∅
  * removed two redundant cases for → in K
  * nth derivative is defined as a helper
derp-zip:
  * implemented zipper optimization
derp-reify:
  * implemented graph reification and dot visualization
derp-test:
  * implemented tests which visualize the results
